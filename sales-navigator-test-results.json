              "summary": "Taxation is not a once a year occurrence. The tax law changes regularly, and so does your income. Since we are coming to the end of the year it is a good time to review your projected federal and state returns so you can make adjustments before year end to effect the outcome. \nAt the state of New Jersey level, there were changes for homeowners and renters to receive greater rebates of rent paid or real estate taxes paid. Some affected seniors. Income levels that qualify are subject to change and the Stay NJ tax break opened up additional breaks for seniors with income up to $500,000. \nMy office is Located in Florham Park, New Jersey. I have been a New Jersey Certified Public Accountant since 1974 and I am also licensed in New  York State. I have owned my own C.P.A .firm since 1983 (Website is www.cpajoe.net). I am a Certified Quickbooks Professional Advisor for both online and desktop versions. \n\nSpecialties: Personal income tax return preparation. Corporate, partnership, LLC and other business tax return preparation.Income tax planning, business planning, business consulting, accounting, recordkeeping, projections, financial statement preparation, including  reviews and compilations.  I also work with startups to assist them in entity selection, taxation and getting their books organized.\n\nIn 2024 I started a Linkedin business page where I have posted articles on taxation and other small business  subjects. Many of the articles are collaborative efforts with linkedin based AI origination followed by professional touches by me and other professionals. For my efforts I was named a top voice in accounting until Linkedin removed those awards. If you wish to access this content, let me know and I'll provide  you a link to those to those I am connected with, and will accept connection requests from those I'm not connected to.\nRegarding Linkedin, I joined here in its initial year, in January 2024 and the marketing people got to know me and I received press opportunities, most notably in the New York Times in September, 2010. The Times article is entitled \"The Social Network That Gets Down to Business\". When linkedin rolled out its games in 2024 I started playing Linkedin and posted an almost daily teaser on the games.With the recent changes in Linkedin's algorithm to support primarily people whose content aligns with their primary focus, I will reduce my posting about the games, but will continue to post in the pinpoint community about the games. I will continue to support players around the world and especially those in the United States, where I do business.",

Since we are coming to the end of the year it is a good time to review your projected federal and state returns so you can make adjustments before year end to effect the outcome. \nAt the state of New Jersey level, there were changes for homeowners and renters to receive greater rebates of rent paid or real estate taxes paid. Some affected seniors. Income levels that qualify are subject to change and the Stay NJ tax break opened up additional breaks for seniors with income up to $500,000. \nMy office is Located in Florham Park, New Jersey. I have been a New Jersey Certified Public Accountant since 1974 and I am also licensed in New  York State. I have owned my own C.P.A .firm since 1983 (Website is www.cpajoe.net). I am a Certified Quickbooks Professional Advisor for both online and desktop versions. \n\nSpecialties: Personal income tax return preparation. Corporate, partnership, LLC and other business tax return preparation.Income tax planning, business planning, business consulting, accounting, recordkeeping, projections, financial statement preparation, including  reviews and compilations.  I also work with startups to assist them in entity selection, taxation and getting their books organized.\n\nIn 2024 I started a Linkedin business page where I have posted articles on taxation and other small business  subjects. Many of the articles are collaborative efforts with linkedin based AI origination followed by professional touches by me and other professionals. For my efforts I was named a top voice in accounting until Linkedin removed those awards. If you wish to access this content, let me know and I'll provide  you a link to those to those I am connected with, and will accept connection requests from those I'm not connected to.\nRegarding Linkedin, I joined here in its initial year, in January 2024 and the marketing people got to know me and I received press opportunities, most notably in the New York Times in September, 2010. The Times article is entitled \"The Social Network That Gets Down to Business\". When linkedin rolled out its games in 2024 I started playing Linkedin and posted an almost daily teaser on the games.With the recent changes in Linkedin's algorithm to support primarily people whose content aligns with their primary focus, I will reduce my posting about the games, but will continue to post in the pinpoint community about the games. I will continue to support players around the world and especially those in the United States, where I do business.",

              "summary": "I’m an expert in Accountancy & Finance Recruitment, with nearly two decades of experience helping people and organisations find their perfect fit. Since founding Three Bridges Recruitment in 2017, I’ve stayed true to the principles of keeping recruitment innovative, straightforward, and always about people, not just positions.\n\nGrowing a team of six has been one of my proudest achievements. But what really excites me is the daily opportunity to work directly with clients, whether it’s helping a business get the talent they need to grow or guiding someone towards a career move that changes their life. \n\nI’ve been told I have a real knack for remembering names and stories, which has helped me build strong, lasting relationships with both companies and applicants. For me, recruitment is about making connections that matter.\n\nOutside of recruitment, I’m passionate about pushing my own limits. Running & exercise is my way of staying focused and driven, and I’m always chasing the next challenge. Over the last few years, I have completed a Power MBA and the London Marathon.\n\nWhen I’m not running or diving into a good business book, you’ll find me as a Scout Leader, giving back to the same community that shaped me when I was younger.\n\nAt the core of everything I do are integrity, hard work, and genuine relationships. I’m committed to keeping recruitment transparent and clear, focusing on what really matters: creating real value for people and businesses alike.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone who will put in the hard work, stay hands-on, and keep things straightforward, let’s have a chat.",

Since we are coming to the end of the year it is a good time to review your projected federal and state returns so you can make adjustments before year end to effect the outcome. \nAt the state of New Jersey level, there were changes for homeowners and renters to receive greater rebates of rent paid or real estate taxes paid. Some affected seniors. Income levels that qualify are subject to change and the Stay NJ tax break opened up additional breaks for seniors with income up to $500,000. \nMy office is Located in Florham Park, New Jersey.

Corporate, partnership, LLC and other business tax return preparation.Income tax planning, business planning, business consulting, accounting, recordkeeping, projections, financial statement preparation, including  reviews and compilations.  I also work with startups to assist them in entity selection, taxation and getting their books organized.\n\nIn 2024 I started a Linkedin business page where I have posted articles on taxation and other small business  subjects. Many of the articles are collaborative efforts with linkedin based AI origination followed by professional touches by me and other professionals. For my efforts I was named a top voice in accounting until Linkedin removed those awards. If you wish to access this content, let me know and I'll provide  you a link to those to those I am connected with, and will accept connection requests from those I'm not connected to.\nRegarding Linkedin, I joined here in its initial year, in January 2024 and the marketing people got to know me and I received press opportunities, most notably in the New York Times in September, 2010. The Times article is entitled \"The Social Network That Gets Down to Business\". When linkedin rolled out its games in 2024 I started playing Linkedin and posted an almost daily teaser on the games.With the recent changes in Linkedin's algorithm to support primarily people whose content aligns with their primary focus, I will reduce my posting about the games, but will continue to post in the pinpoint community about the games. I will continue to support players around the world and especially those in the United States, where I do business.",

But what really excites me is the daily opportunity to work directly with clients, whether it’s helping a business get the talent they need to grow or guiding someone towards a career move that changes their life. \n\nI’ve been told I have a real knack for remembering names and stories, which has helped me build strong, lasting relationships with both companies and applicants. For me, recruitment is about making connections that matter.\n\nOutside of recruitment, I’m passionate about pushing my own limits. Running & exercise is my way of staying focused and driven, and I’m always chasing the next challenge. Over the last few years, I have completed a Power MBA and the London Marathon.\n\nWhen I’m not running or diving into a good business book, you’ll find me as a Scout Leader, giving back to the same community that shaped me when I was younger.\n\nAt the core of everything I do are integrity, hard work, and genuine relationships. I’m committed to keeping recruitment transparent and clear, focusing on what really matters: creating real value for people and businesses alike.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone who will put in the hard work, stay hands-on, and keep things straightforward, let’s have a chat.",

Since founding Three Bridges Recruitment in 2017, I’ve stayed true to the principles of keeping recruitment innovative, straightforward, and always about people, not just positions.\n\nGrowing a team of six has been one of my proudest achievements. But what really excites me is the daily opportunity to work directly with clients, whether it’s helping a business get the talent they need to grow or guiding someone towards a career move that changes their life. \n\nI’ve been told I have a real knack for remembering names and stories, which has helped me build strong, lasting relationships with both companies and applicants. For me, recruitment is about making connections that matter.\n\nOutside of recruitment, I’m passionate about pushing my own limits. Running & exercise is my way of staying focused and driven, and I’m always chasing the next challenge. Over the last few years, I have completed a Power MBA and the London Marathon.\n\nWhen I’m not running or diving into a good business book, you’ll find me as a Scout Leader, giving back to the same community that shaped me when I was younger.\n\nAt the core of everything I do are integrity, hard work, and genuine relationships. I’m committed to keeping recruitment transparent and clear, focusing on what really matters: creating real value for people and businesses alike.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone who will put in the hard work, stay hands-on, and keep things straightforward, let’s have a chat.",

Once we have a shortlist, we then present this information to you by talking through each candidate at length, ideally face to face.\nIn addition, we can provide supporting competency and behavioural data on each candidate. We would agree a set of competencies/behaviours with you at vacancy registration stage, and then present the answers in detail alongside their CV. This is usually aimed at more senior appointments however we’re equally happy to include in our service for all searches.\nBest of all, this targeted bespoke approach is not reflected in our fees – due to us keeping overheads low, we are able to be ultra-competitive.

Since we are coming to the end of the year it is a good time to review your projected federal and state returns so you can make adjustments before year end to effect the outcome. \nAt the state of New Jersey level, there were changes for homeowners and renters to receive greater rebates of rent paid or real estate taxes paid. Some affected seniors. Income levels that qualify are subject to change and the Stay NJ tax break opened up additional breaks for seniors with income up to $500,000. \nMy office is Located in Florham Park, New Jersey. I have been a New Jersey Certified Public Accountant since 1974 and I am also licensed in New  York State. I have owned my own C.P.A .firm since 1983 (Website is www.cpajoe.net). I am a Certified Quickbooks Professional Advisor for both online and desktop versions. \n\nSpecialties: Personal income tax return preparation. Corporate, partnership, LLC and other business tax return preparation.Income tax planning, business planning, business consulting, accounting, recordkeeping, projections, financial statement preparation, including  reviews and compilations.  I also work with startups to assist them in entity selection, taxation and getting their books organized.\n\nIn 2024 I started a Linkedin business page where I have posted articles on taxation and other small business  subjects. Many of the articles are collaborative efforts with linkedin based AI origination followed by professional touches by me and other professionals. For my efforts I was named a top voice in accounting until Linkedin removed those awards. If you wish to access this content, let me know and I'll provide  you a link to those to those I am connected with, and will accept connection requests from those I'm not connected to.\nRegarding Linkedin, I joined here in its initial year, in January 2024 and the marketing people got to know me and I received press opportunities, most notably in the New York Times in September, 2010. The Times article is entitled \"The Social Network That Gets Down to Business\". When linkedin rolled out its games in 2024 I started playing Linkedin and posted an almost daily teaser on the games.With the recent changes in Linkedin's algorithm to support primarily people whose content aligns with their primary focus, I will reduce my posting about the games, but will continue to post in the pinpoint community about the games. I will continue to support players around the world and especially those in the United States, where I do business.",

              "summary": "I’m an expert in Accountancy & Finance Recruitment, with nearly two decades of experience helping people and organisations find their perfect fit. Since founding Three Bridges Recruitment in 2017, I’ve stayed true to the principles of keeping recruitment innovative, straightforward, and always about people, not just positions.\n\nGrowing a team of six has been one of my proudest achievements. But what really excites me is the daily opportunity to work directly with clients, whether it’s helping a business get the talent they need to grow or guiding someone towards a career move that changes their life. \n\nI’ve been told I have a real knack for remembering names and stories, which has helped me build strong, lasting relationships with both companies and applicants. For me, recruitment is about making connections that matter.\n\nOutside of recruitment, I’m passionate about pushing my own limits. Running & exercise is my way of staying focused and driven, and I’m always chasing the next challenge. Over the last few years, I have completed a Power MBA and the London Marathon.\n\nWhen I’m not running or diving into a good business book, you’ll find me as a Scout Leader, giving back to the same community that shaped me when I was younger.\n\nAt the core of everything I do are integrity, hard work, and genuine relationships. I’m committed to keeping recruitment transparent and clear, focusing on what really matters: creating real value for people and businesses alike.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone who will put in the hard work, stay hands-on, and keep things straightforward, let’s have a chat.",
